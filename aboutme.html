      <h2>Hi, I'm Amanda Weber.</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>I am a student at Grinnell College, class of 2021, where I am pursuing a double major in computer science and English. I am currently interning remotely
      as a Technology Summer Analyst at BNY Mellon. I recently finished serving a two-year term in the Grinnell College Student Government Association Treasurer's
      Office, where I balanced an $800,000 budget for the year.</p>
      <p>As my diverse experiences in coding, finance, and writing demonstrate, I enjoy pursuing new experience and opportunities for personal growth, and I adapt
      quickly to new circumstances. If there is one singular thing that I am passionate about, it would be utilizing a variety of different skill sets and resources
      to make knowledge and resources fair and accessible to all people.
      <p>In my free time, I like to write creatively, read, practice Russian, play tennis, volunteer, and experiment with code (which results in things like this website).</p>
      <p>You can connect with me over social media (links below) or by sending me an email through this website.</p>
